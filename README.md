 # Data Preprcoessing Techniques used
 
 1.Data augmentation strategies followed by image annotation. Data augmentation consists of image rotations, contrast, and color adjustments, lightning variations,      random erasing, etc.
 2. Then all the images are made of identical size.
 3. Then image annotation id done.
 
 # Functionalities
 
 Taking records of number of hands detected and  Works with different kinds of orientations.
 
 # Deployment
 
 1. The application can be easily installed as a web-based API on any cloud platform. This installation is similar to a plug and play scenario.
 2. The application can be also be installed in an edge device. This installation provides realtime streaming capabilities to the application.
